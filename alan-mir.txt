    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. /First through github one will fork over the file, and add our TL as a collaberator. After that, you can clone the file, by copying the adress and entering it into the command line using `git clone`. Using cd to get into the clone directory, then branching to your name using `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName`, you can start to make changes. You can always check if the branch was created properly by entering `git branch`. One must use `git status` to see the current status of the file and know if anything should be added. If so, add sadi file with `git add file-name.js`. After adding a file, one must commit to github. Do this by entering `git commit` and you can also leave a message about what it is you added by entering `git commit -m "Message"`. After everything is done and you have added all the files and/or made all changes needed, you must upload to github by entering the push command like so `git push orgin firstName-lastName`. Once it has been uploaded to github, you can submit a Pull Request, using your fork as the base to compare across forks. When making the pull request you can leave a more detailed message about everything you did within the said file. Add your TL as a reviewer as well, and the submit! Afterwards the TL will review the code and accept the merge request. And Done!

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? /Block elements always take the aavailable full width, and always start with a new line like <p> or <h1>. Inline element only take the required width, and these elements do not start on a new line like <a> and <img>

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default /

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? /
 -The box model is what wraps around every html element. The center of the block is the content, where the html element resides. Around the content, there is whats called Padding. This gives a little space around the content, and is transparent. Wrapped around the Padding is whats known as the Border. This can be customized a bit more than just size, you can make it solid, dotted, different colors, ect. And finally what wraps around all that is known as Margin. This is also transparent.
 - Using the box-sizing: border-box;
